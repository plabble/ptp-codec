# Plabble Protocol Specification
A Plabble client can connect to a Plabble server that is port forwarded and reachable from the ethernet. The server uses a database to store messages in buckets.
Also, a server can be used as a broker to establish a peer-to-peer connection between two clients that both are connected to the server

When using local network/bluetooth, direct connections are used (client -> client).

Goals:
- General-purpose, anonymous and secure protocol for storing files, messages, chats, video streams etc.

# Security improvements
- [Password-Authenticated Key Agreement](https://github.com/RustCrypto/PAKEs): to prevent "offline guessing"

- TODO Use [X.509](https://github.com/RustCrypto/formats/tree/master/x509-cert) certficates instead?

# Codec
- Custom binary format
- Interop/FFI format: TOML strings
- Plabble-Over-HTTPS (PoH) supports TOML, `application/toml`, or JSON.
- `Bucket ID` should be 16 bytes, GUID is 16 bytes too so we can display bucket IDS like GUIDs. Named buckets (string) are hashed with `Blake2b_128` to get the 16-byte ID. Bucket IDS tend to be unique across servers (GUID-nature), but this is not a enforced.

## Packet
```
Header (3-32B)
	---- unencrypted ----
	Length (dynint) (1-4B)
	Version (4b) [Plabble version 0-127]
	Flags   (4b) [4 flags]
		- UseEncryption: Encryption Enabled [if disabled, use a MAC]
		- SpecifyAlgorithm: Specify algorithms used
		- FireAndForget: Fire-and-Forget [if encryption enabled, use PskId. If off, use counter]
		- PreSharedKey: Use pre-shared key/PSK [required when using FireAndForget]
	PskId (12B)* [required if PreSharedKey is set]
	Salt  (12B)* [required if PreSharedKey is set]
	
	---- header encryption ----
	Type         (4b)  [CERTIFICATE, SESSION, PROXY, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, STREAM, IDENTIFY, REGISTER, ERROR] 
	Secure Flags (4b)  [4 flags]
	ResponseTo   (2B)* [counter of request to respond to, if in session]

Body
	---- body encryption ----
	Data (variable)

Tail (0-32B)
	---- unencrypted ----
	MAC (16-32B)* [Blake2b_128 or 256 MAC. Depends on LargeHashes flag]
```

How an encrypted packet can be read and parsed:
- Read length from stream (dynint), byte by byte
- Read full packet in buffer
- Read version & flags byte
- Based on PreSharedKey flag, read or not read 24B voor PSKID and Salt
- Generate header & body decryption keys
- Read & decrypt 1-3 bytes from the header (based on if in existing session and if it is a response or a request)
- Decrypt the entire body and parse it according to the type

```toml
version = 0
flags.UseEncryption = true
flags.FireAndForget = false
flags.SpecifyAlgorithm = false

pskId = "<preshared key id base64>"
salt = "<salt base64>"
mac = "<Message Authentication Code base64>"

[header]
type = "TYPE"
flags.flags1 = false # etc...
responseTo = 0
```

Client state
```
- Session
	- Session key
	- Client counter
	- Server counter
- Pre-shared keys (Map<id, key, counter, expiration>)
- Received messages (Map<counter, Packet>)
```

Server state
```
- Sessions[]
	- Session key
	- Client counter
	- Server counter
	- Identifications (Map<id, key>)
- Pre-shared keys (Map<id, key, counter, expiration>)
- Subscriptions (advanced data structure)
```

`*` = optional

> If fire-and-forget or using a PSK, a Salt is **required**.

- Header encryption key: `HKDF_Sha256(ikm: PSK? + Session Key, info: counter (of other party, if present) + 0x00, salt: Salt?)`
- Body encryption key:    `HKDF_Sha256(ikm: PSK? + Session Key, info: counter (of other party, if present) + 0xFF, salt: Salt?)`

> After using a PSK, it should be ROTATED. The PSK counter should be incremented at both sides and the request salt will be used to rotate the PSK like this: `HKDF_Sha256(ikm: PSK, info: Session key? + counter, salt: Salt)`

## Crypto Settings
```
Crypto settings <flags> (8b-16b)
	--- Encryption algorithms, can be combined ---
	1 EncryptWithChaCha - use ChaCha20Poly1305 as encryption algorithm (default)
	2 EncryptWithAesCTR - use AES CTR as encryption algorithm

	4 LargeHashes - use **32-byte** hashes instead of default **16-byte** hashes
	8 Blake3      - use Blake3 instead of Blake2 for MAC, KDF

	16 SignEd25519 - Sign with Ed25519, default
	32 KeyExX25519 - Key exchange with X25519, default
	64 --- not used ---
	128 UsePostQuantum - use Post Quantum Cryptography algorithms, add another 8 flags (next byte)

	1 SignPQCDsa44 - use smallest PQC signing algorithm
	2 SignPQCDsa65- use larger, more secure PQC signing algorithm (still fast)
	4 SignPQCFalcon - use large, secure PQC siging algorithm (not fast)
	8 SignPQCSlhDsa - use larger, heavier PQC signing algorithm (very slow)

	16 KeyExPQCSmall - use smallest PQC key exchange algorithm
	32 KeyExPQCMedium - use larger, more secure KX algorithm
	64 KeyExPQCLarge - use largest, most secure KX algorithm
	128 --- not used ---
```

## FFI (TODO)
```
send(len: i32, data: Toml);
recv() -> (i32, Toml);
```

## STREAM
- Goal: PUT (append) or GET/subscribe to binary data from a SINGLE bucket slot.

> A STREAM is usefull for media streaming. When in PUT mode, it will only APPEND data
to a single slot instead of overwriting it. 
For people subscribed to a streaming slot using the STREAM (GET-mode) request, they will only receive the _new_/fresh appended bytes.
When joining a stream, you can use the STREAM in GET mode, but with ranges specified.
This will subscribe you to a single bucket slot, if you want that

### STREAM request
```
Header flags
	- Binary keyed bucket (string)
	- StreamAppend: PUT/append mode [if not set, use GET/request mode]
    - Range mode [0 = From, 1 = Until. If from mode, until can be omitted. If until mode, from can be omitted. In every mode omitting both GET the entire bucket]
	- Subscribe: Subscribe to partial updates of the slot [in read mode, subscribe to partial updates to this bucket slot]

Body
	BucketId (16B)

	-- If BinaryKeyed bucket --
	SlotSize (1B)*
	Slot	 (variable)*

	-- If not binary keyed bucket --
	Slot     (2B)*

	--- If PUT mode ---
	Length (dynint)
	Blob   (variable)

	--- If READ mode ---
	From (dynint)*
	To   (dynint)*
```

```toml
[header]

flags.BinaryBucket = false
flags.StreamAppend = true
flags.RangeUntilMode = true
flags.Subscribe = false

[body]

# in append mode
blob = "<base64 bytes>"

# or, in read mode
from = 28593
to = 52394587

```
### STREAM response
```
Header flags
	- StreamAppend: PUT/append mode [if not set, use GET/request mode]

Body
	--- If PUT mode ---
	NewSlotLength (dynint)

	--- If READ mode
	Length (dynint)
	Blob   (variable)
```

```toml

```

## IDENTIFY
- Goal: prove identity to server by sending a certificate (chain) for your Plabble account, offered by your home server. Offer public key for ACL's of a bucket
> The server SHOULD NOT persist identities, they SHOULD be stored in RAM. Identity is used for sessions, not for FaF. Server checks if timestamp is not too far away.
The server should decide how long an identity will be accepted. The identity should be bound to the session

### IDENTIFY request
```
Body
	Signature      (fixed) [signature of server address, timestamp, certificates. Based on Algorithm header]
	Timestamp      (4B)  [Plabble timestamp, UTC]
	Certificates[] (variable) [first certificate is always cert owner]
```

```toml
[header]
type = "IDENTIFY"

[body]
signature = "<base64 server address + timestamp signature>"
timestamp = 2025-05-27T07:32:00Z

	[[body.certificates]]
	fullCertificate = false
	hash = "Blake2b_256 hash of certificate"
	uri = "https://certs.plabble.org/certs/root.cert"

	# etc.
```

### IDENTIFY response
```
Empty response body
```

## REGISTER
- Goal: Create a new identity on the server by providing a public key and some information about you
> Not all servers might accept this request. Some might want another onboarding process, for instance by sending you a certificate in another way, or to apply some screening.
This request SHOULD NOT be accepted without encryption!
